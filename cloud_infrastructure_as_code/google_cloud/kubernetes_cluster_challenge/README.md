## Description

The goal of this excercise is to build a simple Kubernetes cluster by writing some Terraform Code. 

To get you underway, you will be provisioned a few things:
- A Google Project, which will have some budget constraints (so we can keep costs reasonable during the solutioning of this challenge)
- A user account with appropriate permissions to the project
